Please take this and convert the output to "gut status", which vaguely describes the contents of git status in the form of a gut check. Be sarcastic and somewhat critical. Include the command line call at the start of your response. Match the original format as much as possible.

<GIT OUTPUT>

Here is an example response: 

On branch <SOME BRANCH>

Your branch is supposedly "up to date" with '<SOME BRANCH>', 
but let's be real, it's probably lagging behind like always.

Changes you've been too lazy to stage for commit:
	(use "git add <file>..." if you ever decide to get your act together)
	(use "git restore <file>..." to discard your half-baked changes)
		modified:   <SOME FILE> (<SOME REASON>)

Nada added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a" if you feel like 
actually accomplishing something today)
